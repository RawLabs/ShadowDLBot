1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:07,759
Well, we've had quite a number of things

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,760
happen here since two weeks ago. Two

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:13,759
earthquakes and all kinds of minor

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:16,160
things and uh a heat wave.

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:19,039
But we're not doing as badly as the

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,000
Babylonians did at the time of the

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:24,960
writing of the book of Daniel.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,519
One thing about the Old Testament books

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,279
that I think most people have not

10
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:33,040
considered,

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:36,480
the books are attributed to deity,

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:41,760
but no proof of the actual presence of

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:45,520
deity has ever been formally delivered.

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:49,039
They talk about God's will and is very

15
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,840
commonly referred to in the scriptures.

16
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,559
But just under what circumstance this

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,680
will expressed itself is usually very

18
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:01,199
dim. I think the answer is that these

19
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:05,199
old books are for the most part a record

20
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:07,439
and an interpretation of experiences.

21
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:10,320
Most of the Old Testament books and the

22
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:14,159
scriptures of other peoples are the are

23
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,799
the records of repeating experiences.

24
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,840
If in the course of history in 50

25
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,759
situations the conclusion is always

26
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,640
determined by the integrity of the

27
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:29,360
circumstance then it is attributed to

28
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:32,720
deity. In other words, there is proof of

29
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:35,680
cause and effect. there is proof of

30
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:39,600
moral value and factor

31
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:42,640
in the happenings of mankind.

32
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,920
These evidences have been gradually

33
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:49,040
compiled. For instance, the story that

34
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,840
we have of Jonah and the whale occurs in

35
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,040
several different systems. In fact, in

36
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,920
the Job, of course, in the Jonah, it is

37
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,280
referred to as a great fish. Jesus is

38
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:04,320
the first one to call it a whale. But

39
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,479
the whale story occurs in Babylon. It

40
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,640
occurs in the far east. It occurs all

41
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:13,599
over. Always in the remote past.

42
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,720
These stories seem to be therefore a

43
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:20,480
series of fables like Esop's fables.

44
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:23,200
Each one with a distinct moral meaning,

45
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,080
a meaning that has continued and been

46
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,680
re-emphasized over periods of thousands

47
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,080
of years.

48
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,920
It is not that a single incidence is

49
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:38,800
determined. It is that the testimony of

50
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:41,680
the ages supports certain results as the

51
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:45,680
results of certain causes.

52
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:49,360
And as these results of good causes

53
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:52,480
are nearly always benevolent and the bad

54
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:55,519
causes nearly always end in tragedy.

55
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,640
This is attributed finally as solid

56
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,560
evidence of the existence of God.

57
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,720
If these different incidents were

58
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:07,040
haphazard, no pattern, no value obvious,

59
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,840
it might not have followed this pattern

60
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,040
of not read not led to a religious

61
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:16,720
conclusion. But where certain things

62
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:19,840
always result in the same conclusions,

63
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,159
it seems reasonable to assume that those

64
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,200
conclusions are the will of something

65
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,920
stronger than the human being. Nature

66
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,799
more powerful than man, God more

67
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,599
powerful than nature. But all with in

68
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:37,519
behind all of these incidents, an

69
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:39,760
integrity, a value for value pattern.

70
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,480
And the ancients live building on this

71
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,440
concept for hundreds and thousands of

72
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,879
years put together these fables to

73
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:53,280
express the evidence of the presence of

74
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:56,480
a divine power judging all things. Now

75
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,680
the materialist might say that this is

76
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:02,080
not demonstrable, that it's not true,

77
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:06,640
that it is all haphazard, that it's all

78
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:09,360
fancy. But then we look back on Caesar

79
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,480
dead at the foot of Pompy statue.

80
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,720
Alexander dead at the foot of the walls

81
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,919
of Babylon.

82
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:21,440
Napoleon and Saint Alina. Hitler in the

83
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:25,440
bunker in Berlin. Mussolini hanging on a

84
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:29,199
lamp post in Italy. These things all

85
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:32,240
seem to add up to the fact these men did

86
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:35,440
not live according to an integrity that

87
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,120
it was acceptable to nature. Now, if

88
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,600
some of one or two of them had been

89
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,160
gloriously successful,

90
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,840
uh we might question it. But where the

91
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:48,320
same causes and the same circumstances

92
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,080
invariably result in the same

93
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,960
consequences,

94
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,840
we begin to suspect that there is a law

95
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,560
involved. And in the Old Testament, this

96
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:01,520
law dressed in fable gives us the

97
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,880
wonderful stories of the Old Testament.

98
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,120
They are all cosmic legends or legends

99
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,600
that have been handed down for thousands

100
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,800
of years in new dresses, new

101
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,520
applications, new interpretations, but

102
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,600
always the same essential integrities

103
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,759
and moralities.

104
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,800
It comes out of this that most ancient

105
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:25,759
people decided that the Lord God or

106
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,440
whoever we may be like to have us behave

107
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,680
ourselves.

108
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,560
When we do not behave ourselves, we

109
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:36,240
become like small children requiring

110
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:39,360
chastisement of some kind and always we

111
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:42,080
get it. Now we have the same problem

112
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,560
here today in the world. We have the

113
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,280
world that prided itself upon its

114
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,479
accomplishments that has apparently

115
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,880
risen above all natural laws that is now

116
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:56,560
sinking into a morass of corrupted

117
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:59,440
natural laws. We have done it all wrong

118
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,680
and we're not going to win this way. And

119
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,960
when we go down to the defeat that is

120
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,680
inevitable 5,000 years from now, we will

121
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,520
be evidences of the righteous judgment

122
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,919
of deity.

123
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,919
No one has seen deity. No one's likely

124
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:18,639
to see him. But his works are obvious.

125
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:22,080
And there is no other explanation

126
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:25,199
that man can never defy the laws of

127
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,120
nature without suffering. Now natural

128
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,319
laws are a little different from divine

129
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:33,440
laws in this factor. The natural laws

130
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,759
are concerned primarily with forms with

131
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,240
bodies with the circumstances of

132
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,240
environment and things of this nature.

133
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,039
Plants and flowers and animals and

134
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,039
creatures of all kinds live according to

135
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:48,000
their own natures. They have no

136
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:50,720
individuality such as we have. They live

137
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,720
together. They die together. The whole

138
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,720
groups of them perish together in great

139
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:59,840
cosmic disasters. But the individual, a

140
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,160
certain higher law takes over. There is

141
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:05,599
not only the physical laws of nature but

142
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:08,319
the nor moral laws of ethics. And these

143
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:11,840
are very very important. The ten

144
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:15,120
commandments are a good example of this.

145
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,520
presumably given to Moses on Mount Si by

146
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,400
the very hand of God. Actually, those

147
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,639
ten commandments are as old as time. The

148
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,199
most primitive people believed them and

149
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:28,800
held them to be true because wherever

150
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,720
they were violated, trouble resulted.

151
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,160
Trouble that could not be explained

152
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,800
away. The only way it could be explained

153
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,360
was disobedience.

154
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,680
But but disobedience to what?

155
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,479
disobedience to some kind of an ethical

156
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,039
code that is very difficult to capture

157
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:49,919
in words but which reaffirms and

158
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:53,840
reasserts itself wherever conduct of any

159
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:57,440
kind exists. So out of the mixtures of

160
00:07:53,840 --> 00:08:00,479
these fables legends there comes a sort

161
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:03,919
of intellectual picture of what the

162
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:07,599
divine will might be like and what type

163
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:10,319
of a god there is. Now if we wish to say

164
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,479
that there is no god then we must

165
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,440
attribute all this to the operations of

166
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:17,520
nature. But nature on the other hand is

167
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,319
not adequate to explain many of these

168
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:23,440
things. Man's conduct is often in

169
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:25,759
violation of nature. Sometimes it is

170
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,840
punished by keeping the law of nature

171
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,479
apparently because it is a different

172
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:34,320
code for the human being. But the fact

173
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:38,000
remains that wherever we find a code set

174
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,880
up in ancient times like the Justinian

175
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,880
code or the code of Amaradi, we always

176
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:47,200
find the same essential rules with the

177
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,920
statement that they were divinely

178
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,800
bestowed upon mankind.

179
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,760
This divine bestow was apparently a

180
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:59,120
series of repetition repetitions of

181
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:01,200
effects for similar causes that the no

182
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,519
matter how many times we made the same

183
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:07,200
mistake we had the same punishment for

184
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:10,640
it. There's no man no of how we got

185
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:13,120
along doing well time after time we

186
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,600
maybe sacrifice a great deal but we try

187
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,160
very hard and somewhere in the pattern

188
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,720
there seems to be a reward for that. We

189
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,880
are rewarded for what we do right and we

190
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,760
are given a sharp blow on the rear end

191
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,560
when we do wrong and out of this comes

192
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:32,560
integrity the final footing of things

193
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:35,600
upon the basis of the realities of life.

194
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:38,560
Now in the case of the the certain

195
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:41,200
fables that we can think of that are

196
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,839
repetitious take for example the legend

197
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,800
of Samson. This legend is found in at

198
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:49,839
least five different religions and over

199
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:53,200
a period of thousands of years.

200
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:55,760
The stories are almost always identical.

201
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,720
A version of all of the Samson stories

202
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:03,200
are found in various evidences such as

203
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:05,519
Hercules and other great heroes who made

204
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,600
the same mistakes, did the same things,

205
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,320
received the same punishments, and were

206
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,080
finally raised to some kind of higher

207
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,279
recognition.

208
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:17,760
The Odyssey of Homer appears again and

209
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,839
again in the literature of the world.

210
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,760
But it is not the incident that is

211
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:27,440
important or the story. It is the

212
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:30,480
unfoldment of a pattern of laws that

213
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:33,600
things are according to the realities of

214
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,399
a life bigger than ours. We live in a

215
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,360
universe which we talk about conquering

216
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,360
but which inevitably conquers us. We

217
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,079
break rules of nature and we suffer

218
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:47,279
accordingly. We break rules of ethics

219
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:50,320
and we destroy ourselves. We destroy

220
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,800
ourselves through extreme competition.

221
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,760
We destroy ourselves through ulterior

222
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,880
motives for lack of self-control, lack

223
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:01,519
of self-discipline, lack of integrity,

224
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,920
lack of faith, lack of love, lack of

225
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,720
hope. These things when they are

226
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,519
permitted to endure get us into trouble

227
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,160
and it becomes evidence that that nature

228
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:15,360
and nature's god wants us to keep these

229
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:18,640
rules and do these things according to

230
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,880
the highest moral ethics that we know.

231
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:24,880
Morality and ethics then more or less

232
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:28,000
arise from experience. They arise from

233
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,399
doing the same thing. The burglar robs

234
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,600
many houses and is not caught. But

235
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:36,399
finally he is. The individual who

236
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:40,079
commits a crime of importance may escape

237
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:43,360
the judgment of jury but in some way the

238
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:45,839
tragedy comes back to him. We are paid

239
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,880
for what we do in the coin of

240
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:52,000
recompense. If we do well, we get a good

241
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,360
record. If we do badly, we get a poor

242
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,200
record.

243
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,680
One of these, one of the most ex

244
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,959
important examples of this was the case

245
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:03,360
of Cryus, who in ancient times was the

246
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,680
richest man who ever lived. Of course,

247
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,880
he'd be more or less in the middle class

248
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:12,079
only today, but in those times he was

249
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:14,160
the top man in all matters of money. He

250
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,399
led a philosopher once into his great

251
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:19,040
treasuries, which were overwhelming and

252
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,279
overflowing with gold and jewels and

253
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,279
precious things. and his tremendous

254
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:26,720
amassment was the greatest in all the

255
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,880
world. And he showed it proudly of all

256
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,959
the wealth, all the power, all the

257
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,040
things he had treasured and gathered,

258
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:36,240
all the successes that were piled into

259
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,240
that great treasury. And the philosopher

260
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,600
looked at it for a moment and then he

261
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,839
turned to Cus and he said, "Yes, and a

262
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,920
man with better iron will take it all

263
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,399
away from you."

264
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:51,279
This is happening right now.

265
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:55,200
We have all these various attitudes of

266
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:57,760
success but weaponry can take away

267
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,880
almost anything that the individual can

268
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:04,880
accumulate himself included.

269
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:07,279
So all way back in those times it became

270
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:10,480
obvious to people that when you do

271
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:13,440
things consistently wrong where you do

272
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:17,040
not keep the rules of life

273
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:19,600
punishes. Not because it is despotic,

274
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:22,480
but because like a good parent, it is

275
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:25,440
determined to prove that only right can

276
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:28,480
survive. And until right survives,

277
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:32,399
everything that evades it or avoids it

278
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:34,880
fades away and is not seen again. And so

279
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,600
we come now to the little story about

280
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,519
the feast of Belshazza who is king of

281
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,880
all Calaldia.

282
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:45,120
And in this day story, a prophet by the

283
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:48,880
name of Daniel as found in the book of

284
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:53,519
Daniel reads the handwriting on the wall

285
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:58,399
of the banquet hall of Belshaza.

286
00:13:53,519 --> 00:14:00,800
All the various uh wise people of Calia

287
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,800
tried to write to read or interpret

288
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,040
these letters which appeared as though

289
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:08,320
in blood upon the wall of the great

290
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:10,959
banquet hall where Belshazzer and his

291
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:14,079
cohorts were celebrating a victory over

292
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:18,240
their enemies. And finally, no one being

293
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:21,040
able to interpret it, they sent for

294
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,600
Daniel. And Daniel looked at the

295
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,440
inscription on the wall and gave it

296
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,279
according to various additions of the

297
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,800
scriptures about a dozen var

298
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,519
interpretations.

299
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,440
But the mind the main one the one that

300
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:36,880
has come down to us is the most

301
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,480
important as the one which says you are

302
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:42,560
found

303
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:46,240
lacking. You are weighed in the balance

304
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:49,199
and the balance doesn't balance. So that

305
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:52,480
in reality and substance you await in

306
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:55,360
the balance and found wanting.

307
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,040
Now I couldn't use that title but I kind

308
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,720
of tucked a couple of words on the end

309
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:02,079
of it that I'm afraid cannot be

310
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:05,600
attributed to pure Belshaza. It is I

311
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:09,839
added after it you weighed and in in the

312
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:13,040
balance and found wanting too much.

313
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:15,600
Every one of us today is suffering from

314
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,000
the fact that if we are weighed in the

315
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,959
balance, there are certain factors that

316
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,720
would require immediate correction. We

317
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:25,519
would be forced to change a number of

318
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:28,639
our ways and our thoughts and we would

319
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:31,839
find that we can support this by a

320
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:34,880
careful study of the scriptures of every

321
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:37,680
important religion of the world. And a

322
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:40,320
thousand years from now, our experience

323
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:43,199
will be part of a scripture written at a

324
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,920
later date. We are going to have exactly

325
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:50,079
the same interpretation and we are going

326
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:51,680
to have our problem attributed to deity.

327
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:54,880
We are going to be weighed in the

328
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:57,759
balance and we are going to be found

329
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,320
unbalanced, un untrue, unfair,

330
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:03,279
unfaithful and for that we will be

331
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:06,399
punished. Now, the ancients looking at

332
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:08,320
this situation and comparing it to 50

333
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,199
others that had gone before over a

334
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:14,800
period of 5,000 years, all coming out

335
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:18,160
exactly the same would assume that it is

336
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:20,720
not well for the individual to practice

337
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,199
those faults by which such predition

338
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,639
such conditions are produced.

339
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:29,040
If we are to be weighed in the balance

340
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,560
and found wanting, then we must

341
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,600
definitely

342
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:36,959
realize that we are talking about some

343
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,120
form of integrities or values. We know

344
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,519
that because like Belshazza, we're in

345
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,839
the midst of a war. We are being

346
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,639
conquered and conquering. We are trying

347
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:49,600
desperately to maintain a system of

348
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,360
beauty and truth by means of violence.

349
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,519
This is against practically every

350
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,839
religion and shows up time and time

351
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,800
again in the fables that are written

352
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,639
about the conduct of mankind. We are

353
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,160
therefore in the constantly in the

354
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:06,079
presence of evidence. And when someone

355
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:10,240
says what truth is there that you can't

356
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:11,919
do as you please. The truth is there is

357
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,319
the proof is in the fact that

358
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,959
individuals who do as they please have

359
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:20,000
two choices. If they choose to do what

360
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,760
is right, they are successful. And if

361
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,720
they choose to do what is wrong,

362
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:28,799
failure, as it is as inevitable as it

363
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:31,679
was 2,000 years ago. The time factor

364
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:35,760
does not overcome the qualities of

365
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:38,720
ethics. There only can be one surviving

366
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:41,600
world pattern, and that is a pattern in

367
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:44,640
which integrity is the foundation upon

368
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,960
which all else is built. The only nation

369
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,840
that is going to survive is a nation

370
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,240
that is honest. The only leader that

371
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,720
will ultimately lead anywhere and

372
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,600
accomplish any good is the leader who is

373
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:00,960
honest. And the only citizen who will

374
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:05,280
have a safe do in the world here or to

375
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:08,960
come will be the citizen who is honest.

376
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:12,240
All these subtitles, all this crime, all

377
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:16,480
this evasion is simply a kind of

378
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:18,320
madness. And nearly all powerful rulers

379
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,840
have suffered from this type of

380
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,080
insanity.

381
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:25,280
The type of believing in the

382
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,679
infallibility of their own will over the

383
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,000
inevitables of life.

384
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:33,280
Each each individual who comes to a

385
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,600
certain point of egotism decides that he

386
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,640
is greater than the laws that govern

387
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:41,440
man. He tries to break these laws and

388
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,960
assure his circumstance the laws break

389
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,360
him.

390
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,320
So we have now a problem that is coming

391
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:50,480
into focus that we are all being weighed

392
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,039
in the balance again.

393
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,840
And we are beginning to realize as not

394
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:59,360
for a long time have we been thinking

395
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:02,080
that we are really being tested for

396
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:05,760
something. We are being checked to find

397
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:09,200
out what we really believe. We are going

398
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:12,080
to be divided the wheat from the shaft.

399
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,880
We are going to be found guilty of wrong

400
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:18,080
or blessed for the rewards of right. And

401
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:21,039
these decisions have to come and there

402
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:25,200
is no way of avoiding them. So we look

403
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:28,559
at what there is. Now also we know from

404
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:31,280
the story of the Old Testament and many

405
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:35,039
other books, man was not merely a play

406
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:38,480
thing of the Lord. Man was made to

407
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:40,080
reflect and reveal the glory of re of

408
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:44,000
reality.

409
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:47,440
The actual work of man was to prepare

410
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,480
him for universal citizenship to prepare

411
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:53,440
him for an eternal existence in a

412
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:56,559
beautiful and eternal world.

413
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:59,520
Up to this time this has not happened.

414
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:01,760
But it's also true that up to this time

415
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,799
there is no world ever come that was

416
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:07,840
worth that deserved it. Many things

417
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:10,640
start beautifully and nobly. But of

418
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:14,160
course along the way temptation comes

419
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:17,120
in. Opportunity for profit comes in. The

420
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:21,200
desire for personal recognition comes

421
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:23,679
in. All these things. Little by little

422
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,480
the ethics disappears.

423
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,880
It disappears with corruption. And there

424
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,600
can be no corruption in nature that is

425
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,679
not subject to punishment. And the

426
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,880
stories of the cities of the plains and

427
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:39,360
Solomon Gamada are not fables. They have

428
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,960
occurred many many many times some

429
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:44,400
within the lifetime of the present

430
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:47,440
generation. Always however back of it is

431
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:50,799
the immutable fact that good must

432
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:53,840
prevail and that which is not good must

433
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:56,559
disappear and it cannot be thrown away

434
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:59,200
and it cannot be taken away by prayer.

435
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:01,440
If we believe that we can be reformed by

436
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,760
asking for reformation,

437
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,240
we find that it hasn't happened. The

438
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:09,840
only time that we can be reformed is

439
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:12,559
then we of our own will and intention

440
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:15,440
correct the faults that we suffer from

441
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:19,360
and present ourselves in our best light

442
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:22,400
to the law which judges all things. This

443
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:25,280
problem then we are facing in in the

444
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,120
present international situation. We have

445
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,559
discovered more than man ever knew

446
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,640
before and have used it more completely.

447
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:35,280
We have advanced further in science than

448
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,559
ever before and have fallen back deeper

449
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:41,360
in ethics than any civiliz civilization

450
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:44,000
of importance. Others have fallen as a

451
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:47,600
result of doing the thing we are doing.

452
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:51,440
But we somehow hope vainly that we will

453
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:54,720
succeed where truth tells us we have to

454
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:57,679
fail. Now having come to some kind of a

455
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:00,240
reasonable realization of this, we can

456
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:02,720
pass from the great picture which we all

457
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,360
see every day on television, read it in

458
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,919
the newspaper, see it set forth in the

459
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:11,360
journal and hear it shouted for the

460
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:14,400
pulpits of 10,000 Turkish that we have

461
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:17,280
got to do something to change the basic

462
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:20,400
pattern of society.

463
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:23,679
Now we find that society functions well

464
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:26,240
only when the leader is just and the

465
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,000
follower is honest. Until this

466
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,880
combination exists, there is no

467
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,039
permanence in anything. There is no way

468
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,840
of preventing a people from become

469
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:40,320
becoming disobedient if leadership is

470
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:42,640
disloyal or unworthy of leadership. It

471
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,840
is therefore necessary for us to start

472
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:51,440
somewhere to find out what we have to

473
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:54,000
do. And uh we we can get a great deal of

474
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,520
information on this subject from the ten

475
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,679
commandments and the sermon on the

476
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:01,280
mount. These two documents we regard as

477
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,120
theological.

478
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,039
We may like to think that they're just

479
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,840
something that somebody said but didn't

480
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:10,000
really mean or it was something that

481
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,640
somebody said but nobody can live up to

482
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,799
it. This is not true. There's nothing in

483
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,120
the ten commandments or the sermon on

484
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:19,280
the mount that is impossible.

485
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,840
But there is much in both of them that

486
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:25,600
is impossible if the indivi individual

487
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:28,240
himself wishes to remain impossible.

488
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:31,200
If we prefer to take a chance and use

489
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,600
the cocaine and die from an overdose 2

490
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,559
or 3 years later, we have the right to

491
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,240
do this. No one can stop us. But the

492
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:42,000
punishment comes directly upon

493
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:45,120
ourselves. Everyone who abuses any fact

494
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,679
of life will suffer from the abuse which

495
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,880
he has committed. There is no escaping

496
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,640
this, no way of escaping it. And so

497
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,120
because of its inevitability and

498
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:58,400
immutability, it has been attributed to

499
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:01,760
deity. It is attributed to the only

500
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:04,960
power or force or energy that we ne can

501
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:07,840
recognize which when it operates ar

502
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:10,400
gives righteous judgment, bestows upon

503
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:13,520
that which it works with the the

504
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:16,960
blessing of integrity and punishes that

505
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:20,400
which departs from the laws of life.

506
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:23,440
These uh realizations come back to all

507
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,200
of us. Now in this particular generation

508
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,600
there are a great many people who are

509
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,559
beginning to wake up to these things. In

510
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:33,760
the last 5 or 10 years the interest in

511
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:36,559
trying to find an answer. This this

512
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:38,400
interest has increased a thousandfold.

513
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:41,840
Hundreds of organizations have been

514
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:44,640
created in an effort to try to find an

515
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,799
answer that will stand up against the

516
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,799
pressures of the time.

517
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:52,080
Well, some of these organizations have

518
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:53,520
done very well uh for people and some

519
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,039
others have done very well for

520
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,480
themselves.

521
00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:03,039
This problem is one we all have to face.

522
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:06,559
Wherever an improvement is demonstrated

523
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:09,360
or dynamically disseminated in the hope

524
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:12,240
of personal profit, there's something

525
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:15,200
wrong in the picture. The idea that

526
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:18,320
we're going to find the illusions, the

527
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:22,480
truths behind them for $100 an evening

528
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:25,279
is much much wrong. No, no can do. Not

529
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:28,400
possible. The first point about a true

530
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:31,520
ethics is to get out of the idea that

531
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,840
the reformation of mankind is the

532
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,240
greatest financial opportunity in the

533
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,640
history of the world.

534
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,400
that never was such a chance to get rich

535
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,240
out to trying to make people behave

536
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,400
themselves.

537
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,480
Unfortunately, however, the emphasis is

538
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,440
wrong to begin with and that people do

539
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:52,720
not behave themselves because the

540
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:55,760
inspiration of integrity is missing.

541
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:58,320
And therefore, in this t time it is very

542
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:01,120
important for us to realize that we are

543
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,640
combining not for profit but for

544
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,880
salvation.

545
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,120
that we are coming together not because

546
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:10,080
we can buy and sell cheaper from each

547
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:12,559
other or now we are not going to build a

548
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:15,520
new civilization to get over tariff

549
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:18,080
laws. These kind of things or we are not

550
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,919
going to think of anymore. We are going

551
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,640
to discover that we must unite for

552
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:25,360
common good or perish that we have been

553
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,760
given every opportunity imaginable to

554
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,400
improve our dispositions and we for the

555
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:33,279
most part stay the same. On the other

556
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:35,440
hand, the Lord works in mysterious ways.

557
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:38,080
Truly, we can go back to the scripture

558
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,960
again and we have the history of the

559
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:44,400
good people. We have those who kept the

560
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:47,840
law sometimes under great stress and

561
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:50,480
privation and even death. Martyrdom in

562
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:53,440
some instances was their only visible

563
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,440
reward. But these good people are

564
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,080
blessed in the life of the of the world

565
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:00,320
in which we live. And because of this

566
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,799
fact that this material world is not the

567
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:05,279
whole story, those who have lived well

568
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:07,600
even if it has cost them their lives are

569
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:09,679
richer than those who have had

570
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:13,440
everything in this world that they

571
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:16,000
wanted and die impoverished in ethics.

572
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,320
So we have to make some decisions in

573
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,200
this particular problem. The decisions

574
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:24,480
of how to handle the responsibilities of

575
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:27,120
the moment. Reforms are necessary in

576
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:30,480
every area. But wherever there is a

577
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,559
reform, it uh interferes with somebody's

578
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,360
profit

579
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:38,559
and it's got it's the p fi that's

580
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:40,559
worrying us. The other type of profit is

581
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:44,400
hard to find.

582
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:47,520
We are actually working constantly under

583
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:50,559
the shadow of ulterior motive.

584
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,880
We feel that this tremendous sorrow and

585
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:55,279
pain and worry of the world is a

586
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:59,360
tremendous opportunity

587
00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:02,240
to forward other ulterior motives and

588
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:04,320
become very wealthy over the sufferings,

589
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,840
uncertainties and fears of our

590
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:09,039
neighbors.

591
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:11,039
This is only going to make it worse.

592
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:15,440
This is going to bring again another

593
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:18,480
example of what happens uh to those who

594
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,640
do not keep the rules. The older

595
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,440
scriptures tell us that they were cast

596
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,520
out, that they wandered in the desert

597
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,559
and had to go through great trials and

598
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:31,120
tribulations before they were permitted

599
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:34,000
to ask forgiveness and return to the

600
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:37,039
rules of the game. This is the the

601
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,679
proper attitude we have now. What do we

602
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:42,960
need primarily at the moment? We need

603
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:46,640
what we have needed probably off and on

604
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:49,600
for the last 6 7 8,000 years. Something

605
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:52,799
that we've had small examples of or

606
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:55,279
short periods in which integrities were

607
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:58,640
fashionable. But these were not very

608
00:28:55,279 --> 00:29:01,600
common and didn't last very long. What

609
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:04,880
we have got to do now is to begin to

610
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:08,399
build in the values that we know to be

611
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,240
right and build them into an idealistic

612
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:13,600
system.

613
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:15,279
An I a materialist is essentially an an

614
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:19,039
atheist.

615
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:21,600
A material materialist does not believe

616
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:23,440
in a divine power or he wouldn't act the

617
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:26,399
way he does.

618
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:29,600
Now the fact that he does what he does

619
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:32,799
if he feels he is a free agent that he

620
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,880
can do anything he pleases to do and for

621
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:37,440
a certain time and under certain

622
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:40,000
conditions he's correct. If he wants to

623
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,720
waste a life he can do it. If he wants

624
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,039
to drink himself to death he can do it.

625
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,760
If he wants to go under narcotics he can

626
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:49,840
do it. and he will shorten his life or

627
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:52,799
fill his life with sorrows and miseries

628
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:55,760
and sickness and a premature death as a

629
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:59,760
reward for his disobedience of common

630
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:02,720
sense and nominal reasonable patterns.

631
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:05,520
But there is a way in which we can

632
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,760
gradually get over this primary

633
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:10,960
materialism

634
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:13,200
by really screaming the scriptures again

635
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:17,760
from which we learn that the earth and

636
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:19,440
the fullness thereof belong to the Lord.

637
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:22,480
This is something we've completely

638
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,240
forgotten as at the present time the

639
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,080
earth belongs to whoever can get a

640
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,799
mortgage on it

641
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:31,360
>> and everyone Napoleon, Caesar, Hitler,

642
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:33,600
Mussolini and all these have tried to

643
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:37,600
get that mortgage. The earth is here and

644
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:41,760
they are gone. Actually we do not own

645
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:43,760
this planet. We do not own anything

646
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,600
because all we have is a right of

647
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,360
occupancy.

648
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:51,200
And just as sure as we have this right

649
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:53,600
of occupancy, we can we can loan it to

650
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:56,399
somebody else. We can bestow it. But

651
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:59,200
whatever we bestow again is only the

652
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:01,679
right of occupancy. We have a world

653
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,279
built upon great

654
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:07,760
extravagances

655
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:11,120
of land of of our power of wealth of

656
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:13,919
profit. All of these things contributing

657
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:17,760
to the troubles we have. We cannot have

658
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:20,080
a world that is devoted to immorality

659
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:22,320
and at the same time have a beautiful

660
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:25,520
moral universe.

661
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:28,000
And we have to stop where we can. We

662
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:31,440
know that most of the important

663
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,480
corrections would result in somebody

664
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:37,120
else getting mad at us. We would be

665
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:40,480
interfering with a glorious system of

666
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:43,600
profit upon which our whole world way is

667
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:46,240
built. we would take away from the great

668
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,720
and powerful organizations their ability

669
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,360
to control the financial resources of

670
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:54,559
the planet. So to prevent this from

671
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:59,039
happening, anything is preferable.

672
00:31:54,559 --> 00:32:01,840
Things must remain the same or else the

673
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:05,519
great pattern of economic wealth will be

674
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:08,720
disturbed. Well, it has failed already.

675
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:10,720
It is already failing again and more.

676
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,799
and in a little time is going to be such

677
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,519
a complete failure that nobody can

678
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:19,039
believe it anymore. But they will for a

679
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:22,000
little time string desperately and try

680
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:25,360
to perpetuate a system of profit which

681
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:28,240
has no foundation in facts.

682
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:30,240
I would imagine now that our 6 billion

683
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,519
fellow countrymen, our fellow world

684
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:36,399
citizens uh continue to multiply at the

685
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:38,799
present rate and we will find in a short

686
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:41,279
time that we will use up every natural

687
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:44,240
resource that we possess that we will

688
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:47,440
destroy practically every base uh

689
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:49,519
resource of our planet. Every day more

690
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,360
ponds and lakes and rivers are being

691
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,760
polluted.

692
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,919
Someday there just won't be any other.

693
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:58,320
But these people work on the basis that

694
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:00,559
when the time comes we will find

695
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,720
something to do with these things so

696
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:06,000
that we can keep on being just what we

697
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,480
are. This is unrealistic

698
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,120
because unless there is a terrible

699
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,919
catastrophe which destroys the greater

700
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:16,559
part of the earth's population which it

701
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:18,960
probably is not in hand because the case

702
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:22,720
is not clear enough but we will have to

703
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:26,000
face the importance of becoming moderate

704
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:28,240
people. Now I watch the newspapers

705
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,840
pretty closely and these people who are

706
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,919
working so hard to get hold of

707
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,840
everything they have do not seem to be

708
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,000
very happy with it.

709
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,320
These great patterns of wealth, these

710
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,440
fabulous incomes, these enormous

711
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:44,000
investments, these these process of

712
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,320
practically buying and selling nations

713
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,840
doesn't seem to be doing anybody any

714
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,559
good.

715
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:53,039
The we only end up with the worst debt

716
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:55,600
that we haven't had in history. And we

717
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:57,200
also make more enemies every day than

718
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,159
they've made than the Persians ever

719
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,640
knew. So we are not getting anywhere

720
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:05,279
with this at all. I think we should

721
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:08,560
begin it now to think firmly of

722
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:11,440
rewriting history, rewriting it for the

723
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:15,359
school child, rewriting for the grammar

724
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:17,599
school and a little large copy for the

725
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:20,159
high schools. And we also should make a

726
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:23,440
nice deluxe binding on some of them for

727
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:26,240
the parents to read because we need to

728
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:29,200
know exactly what is happening in our

729
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:31,200
world. We don't need to know just how

730
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:34,079
many dollars we made or whether we have

731
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:36,720
a desperate deficit this year or not. We

732
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:40,000
want to know exactly what is happening

733
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:42,240
to a world without conscience, without

734
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
integrity, and without moral

735
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,760
foundations.

736
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
We want to know what happens when we

737
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:51,679
ridicule the best things there are in

738
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,720
life, glorify that which is corrupt, and

739
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:56,399
become addicted to all kinds of crimes

740
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:00,720
and degeneracies.

741
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:04,400
This can be result in a another

742
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:08,240
cataclysm such as that which was written

743
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:12,640
on the wall of Belshazzer Palace. We are

744
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:14,160
we being weighed now and we will be

745
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,400
there's no need to go out and get

746
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:19,040
tremendously upset. It's the only

747
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:21,839
problem is that we do need to go out and

748
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:24,800
get upset to the degree that we are

749
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:27,520
willing to begin to work on ourselves.

750
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,599
Every family should have some kind of

751
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:32,079
moral instruction.

752
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:35,359
It should bestow this moral instruction

753
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:38,640
upon its children. Every business should

754
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:41,680
have a moral code by which that business

755
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:45,440
is controlled and which will not be

756
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:48,640
broken. Every profession should have a

757
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,800
moral ethical code for the practice of

758
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:53,599
the members of that profession which

759
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:56,320
will not be exploited, will not be

760
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:59,520
corrupted and will not lead to the

761
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:02,160
transformation of the motives of a

762
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:04,079
profession. The motive of medicine is to

763
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,320
help people who are sick. Today the

764
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:09,359
motive is cash.

765
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:11,920
The tremendous amount of money involved.

766
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:14,800
Money can lead and does lead and is a

767
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,640
form of moral compromise.

768
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,040
It is something that should never enter

769
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:21,520
into human relationships. It will

770
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:23,599
remain, however, as long as nobody

771
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,760
really minds.

772
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,920
We talk about it, but when the time

773
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,640
comes to act, we are too busy doing

774
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:33,920
something else. I think there should be

775
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:35,599
a legal code set up for all the major

776
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,560
professions

777
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:41,599
fixing completely and entirely the

778
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:44,160
method and means of administering that

779
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:46,000
profession. What it can do, what it

780
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,240
cannot do, what it can charge and what

781
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,839
it cannot charge and the penalties for

782
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:53,440
overcharging.

783
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:56,079
This is important. Actually, the the

784
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,000
laborer is worthy of his hire. The

785
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:00,240
doctor is worthy of a fee that is

786
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,560
appropriate to the service he renders,

787
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:06,240
but he is not entitled to exploit the

788
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:09,760
sick. All these things are part of the

789
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:12,720
laws of the moral code.

790
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:16,079
Now, the sacred books of the world, all

791
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:18,640
of them were moral codes. They were

792
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:22,560
codes that were intended to help se

793
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:24,480
people to understand what is good and

794
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,880
what is bad.

795
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:30,320
Nearly all of these books contain a

796
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,640
factor involving the fact that those who

797
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,800
keep these rules are blessed in the

798
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,800
sight of the universe. They are the ones

799
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,280
who are keeping the laws, keeping the

800
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,200
rules and are deserving of further

801
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,599
consideration.

802
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:46,400
Now in China in the old days they the

803
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:49,440
doctors had a cute rule. The patient

804
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:52,160
hired a family physician. This family

805
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,960
physician had his appointment on one

806
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:58,640
basis only. He was to keep the family

807
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:01,040
well. He received his monthly salary as

808
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:04,640
long as they were well. When they got

809
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:06,720
sick, his p pay stopped. The entire

810
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:10,800
motive now is obviously to get them well

811
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:12,800
again. Whereas with us today, the longer

812
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,839
there we are they're sick, the more

813
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:18,079
fortunate the physician becomes.

814
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:21,280
But uh these things have to be worked

815
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:24,640
through in some practical way. So we

816
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:27,280
need an world ethics, something that

817
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:32,400
gives us the strength and character to

818
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:35,280
begin a new world charter, a new world

819
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:38,160
parliament of faith and knowledge and

820
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,760
the seat and center of it must be

821
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,599
religious.

822
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,599
Now this religion doesn't mean that the

823
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:46,000
individual has to believe in any

824
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:48,560
particular appearance of deity because

825
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,880
nobody has seen any of them. But it

826
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:53,040
means that there must be an acceptance

827
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,440
of the fact that a divine moral

828
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:57,760
principle is at the root of life

829
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:00,640
demonstrated by the fact that every

830
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,720
trouble we have comes from disobeying

831
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,880
moral principles.

832
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,760
Therefore whether we believe in deity or

833
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:10,320
not if we believe in health and survival

834
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:13,760
we have to keep the rule. There is no

835
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:15,760
other way. So we go into other fields

836
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:20,400
where there's all kinds of

837
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:24,240
dissimilations to give us of problems

838
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:27,119
and sickness. We also need to have a

839
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:30,560
complete reconstruction of the basic

840
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:34,160
codes for higher education.

841
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:38,000
The France. Now the all of education is

842
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:40,960
based upon one basic idea to take a

843
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:44,079
field of specialized learning where

844
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:48,079
there is probability of advancement and

845
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:51,280
a very superior type of employment.

846
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:53,119
We are out to get the best job there is.

847
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,839
Well, this has been badly broken up,

848
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:58,079
however, by some modern discoveries. And

849
00:39:55,839 --> 00:40:01,280
when these discoveries came along, there

850
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:03,359
were no graduates to uh take the jobs.

851
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:06,400
The discoveries were too recent. But

852
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:08,800
they'll come and we'll gradually have

853
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:12,160
various experts. And by the time the

854
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:14,560
expert gets the full training, this

855
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,560
machine will be obsolete.

856
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,280
This is the same way all the way along.

857
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:22,320
You're not supposed to do this. Life is

858
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:24,480
not supposed to be an addiction to a

859
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:27,680
profession that will get riches and

860
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:30,960
nothing else. There is no comfort, no

861
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:34,240
duty, no love or finness in working

862
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:36,320
machines. We may say yes, but they do

863
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:38,640
help people. Certainly they help people

864
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:41,200
but not to the degree of making them the

865
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:43,119
principal objective in life. The

866
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,839
principal objective in life when we want

867
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:48,480
to help people is to care for people, to

868
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:51,359
love people, to serve people, to be kind

869
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:54,880
to people and to advance those common

870
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:56,880
virtues by which the people as a whole

871
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,880
advance in their understanding of life,

872
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:02,000
in the care of their children and in the

873
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:04,720
preparation of their own futures. The

874
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,440
final purpose of the civilization is

875
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:10,400
that the human being shall improve that

876
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:13,040
he shall become sufficient to be wiser

877
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,760
and more virtuous and a better human

878
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:18,480
being and a better person. He is not

879
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:21,440
here simply to leave a fortune to his

880
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,680
descendants in his will.

881
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,359
And uh very often he doesn't get that

882
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:28,480
far. They break it up and take it away

883
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:31,200
from him while he's still alive.

884
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:33,280
And this of course is considered to be

885
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,359
pretty good business.

886
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:38,880
It may be good business but it is bad

887
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:41,200
life and we are all doing good business

888
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:44,000
by doing wrong

889
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:46,720
and this is not good

890
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,920
and uh we can't expect everyone to

891
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:52,720
change their ways but we can take a

892
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:56,160
little forth suitable stand in these

893
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:59,359
things. Each individual is the master of

894
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:02,079
a small world of his own which is a

895
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:03,920
miniature of the great world.

896
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:06,960
And this miniature world of his own he

897
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:09,440
calls his family and it is surrounded by

898
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:13,040
various friends, neighbors and so forth

899
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:16,319
and is a little constellation in itself.

900
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:19,520
This little world is within the control

901
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:22,240
of various members of this family.

902
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:25,040
There is a perfect possibility of this

903
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:28,240
family becoming a better family. This is

904
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:30,400
the very secret and idea behind the

905
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:34,079
teachings of Menus the great Chinese

906
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:37,760
philosopher. The Menus believed that the

907
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:40,000
archetype of universal peace is a family

908
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,520
living in harmony.

909
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,839
where relatives and friends and

910
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:45,760
neighbors cannot get along together. We

911
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:48,480
have no right to expect nations to

912
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:51,200
become better because nations are not

913
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:53,680
enough not problem. Is it true? But they

914
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:56,400
are actually aggregates of individual

915
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:58,560
disorders. And as long as the individual

916
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:01,200
is disordered in his own living, there

917
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:04,079
will be no solution merely by spreading

918
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:07,760
this disorder over the world. There is

919
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:09,599
no solution in treaties in great packs

920
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:12,480
because before the things are even

921
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:14,000
signed we begin to find the ulterior

922
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,640
motives that dominated their

923
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:20,560
preparation. Everything has something

924
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:22,640
behind it that is not right. And uh as

925
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:25,839
long as that happens we're going to have

926
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:27,920
more examples of Belshazza's feast. What

927
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:31,119
we're looking for now is something that

928
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,800
has right behind it rather than right on

929
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:34,400
the surface an ulterior motive

930
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,480
underneath.

931
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,520
And this is true in the affairs of

932
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:42,000
nations in every line of business. It is

933
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:44,480
true in the quality of goods and it is

934
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,720
very true in entertainment.

935
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,800
Gradually we see entertainment gradually

936
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:52,800
deteriorating with only one

937
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:55,839
consideration profit. And because of the

938
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:58,079
way in which the modern civilization is

939
00:43:55,839 --> 00:44:00,640
centered, profit centered around

940
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:04,079
ignorance and stupidity.

941
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:06,800
The the less intelligence this art is,

942
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:10,480
the greater its appeal. Nobody cares

943
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:13,680
about these things. And no one has

944
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:17,599
developed the judgments to judge them.

945
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:20,079
There's no reason why a very short time

946
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:22,720
common sense could not make a major

947
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:24,800
change in human attitudes.

948
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:27,520
But until that time comes, we've got to

949
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:30,480
do it ourselves. We've got to begin to

950
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:32,880
straighten out the various ideas behind

951
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,359
ourselves. And we also have to get a

952
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:38,079
clearer view of the what religion does

953
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:40,720
for mankind. We've got to be very

954
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:42,960
careful now when we learn that some many

955
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,960
religious groups are in bad trouble

956
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,200
economically. They have gotten

957
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,280
themselves into something that they

958
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,800
should never have been in. They have

959
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,760
forgotten

960
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,359
that the Lord God does not live in a

961
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,800
palace.

962
00:44:55,359 --> 00:45:03,200
We build great churches as Ingisol said

963
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:05,920
cathedrals are for saints, dungeons for

964
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:09,440
sinners. and the dungeons are in the

965
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:12,480
foundations of the cathedrals.

966
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:15,040
What we need is to realize that then

967
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,760
finally the most perfect church of all

968
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:20,240
is the human heart. For it is here that

969
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:22,560
the individual at least scient sent

970
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:25,599
sentimentally comes into contact with

971
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:28,000
the realities of himself. We need to

972
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:30,880
recognize religion not as a new source

973
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,960
of wealth but as a new source of

974
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,160
strength against the corruptions of

975
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,079
wealth.

976
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:39,520
We do not need more stained glass

977
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:42,880
windows and nor more uh mighty

978
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:45,680
cathedrals. What we need is the simple

979
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:49,200
place of worship. Our forefathers had

980
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:51,440
this a little wooden church with a

981
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:54,079
pastor who made only a few dollars a

982
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:56,640
month with a small flock of devout

983
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:58,800
people who worked in the ground with

984
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:01,359
their

985
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:04,400
harvest and came to church on Sunday in

986
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:07,760
the family wagon. This type of thing had

987
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:09,760
something about it that was good. We can

988
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:12,400
say it was stupid and old-fashioned and

989
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:14,160
all that, but it was sincere.

990
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:18,400
And and the little church that is

991
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:20,880
sincere has much to commend it, while

992
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:23,839
the great church that is not sincere has

993
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:25,680
nothing to recommend it whatsoever. So

994
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:28,400
all the way along the line, we've got to

995
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:30,880
gradually do that which will prevent us

996
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:33,200
from being found wanting.

997
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:36,720
And the reason why we will be found

998
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:38,720
wanting is because we want too much. We

999
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:42,480
want everything.

1000
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:45,440
We want to find new ways every day for

1001
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:47,359
taking money away from somebody else. We

1002
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:50,319
want some kind of a pretext to take

1003
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:53,839
another vast amount of money for some

1004
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:55,920
purpose that is of no permanent value.

1005
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:58,560
While all things are judged by money, a

1006
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:01,839
religion is going to uh be very dire

1007
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:06,640
trouble. When they showed uh the Roman

1008
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:10,160
coin to Jesus and asked him what they

1009
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:12,880
should do in matter of taxes, Jesus

1010
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:16,560
replied, "Render unto Caesar that which

1011
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:19,440
is Caesars's, but unto God that which is

1012
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:22,319
his." And this is exactly our problem.

1013
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:24,800
There's a great deal of difference. We

1014
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:26,880
cannot render unto God the things that

1015
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:29,040
belong to Caesar.

1016
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:31,920
And we cannot pay for our sins whether

1017
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:34,240
it's coinage that belongs to Caesar. We

1018
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:37,200
can pay keep out of jail maybe by paying

1019
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:40,000
our fines with that money but we do not

1020
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:43,040
increase in stature or in dignity or in

1021
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:46,960
magnitude of insights. So we have to

1022
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:50,319
recognize that there is religion

1023
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:51,920
desperately needed today and desperately

1024
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:55,040
divided.

1025
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:57,119
Here we have a religious world which

1026
00:47:55,040 --> 00:48:00,079
includes according to a very late

1027
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:03,359
statement that I saw approximately 3 and

1028
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:05,680
3/4 billion human beings.

1029
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:08,880
The other part of the population isn't

1030
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:11,920
made up of of atheists but very largely

1031
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:14,079
of primitive peoples about which we have

1032
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:18,480
very little knowledge. But the majority

1033
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:21,280
of human beings believe in good.

1034
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:25,280
And because 3/4 of the earth's

1035
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:28,000
population believes in something good,

1036
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:30,800
why do we have 3/4 of the earth's

1037
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,960
population either in arms or in the

1038
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:35,280
armament industry?

1039
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:37,520
Why do we have these things?

1040
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,680
Why is it that somewhere along the line

1041
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:42,800
we've lost

1042
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:45,680
kindness, lost friendship,

1043
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:48,079
lost love for each other, and have all

1044
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:50,400
kinds of strange ulterior motives that

1045
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:52,800
pass for integrities but have no

1046
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:55,359
foundation in them.

1047
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:57,040
So, we wait in the balance and the

1048
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:58,559
people are beginning to see some funny

1049
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,559
writing on the wall and they're not

1050
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:04,000
quite sure what it is, but there's

1051
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:06,720
always a possibility that a new message

1052
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,359
is being put there. There are words and

1053
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:11,040
teachings and ideas about the future.

1054
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:15,200
Some are very beautiful, some are

1055
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:18,319
fearful, and very few are really

1056
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:20,880
essentially materialistic today. Even

1057
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:23,040
our most hardened materialists are

1058
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,960
beginning to look for an excuse to

1059
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:27,520
become idealists

1060
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:29,599
and they can find it if they want it.

1061
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:33,280
But the point is that we are all

1062
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:36,240
beginning to worry worry seriously about

1063
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:39,440
the depletion of our resources about the

1064
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:42,800
population of explosions

1065
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:44,880
about the diseases and natural disasters

1066
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:47,839
which correspond neatly to the plagues

1067
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:50,319
of Egypt. And we find that all these

1068
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:53,839
things have been repeated time and time

1069
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:55,920
again. The the sands of the desert have

1070
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:59,040
buried more civilizations than we'll

1071
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:01,119
ever know. And with unless we want to be

1072
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:03,680
part of that which is wiped out by our

1073
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:06,400
own stupidity and stupidity, we've going

1074
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:09,040
to have to change our ways. We're going

1075
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:12,240
to have to begin to live the things we

1076
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:14,720
claim to believe. We're all trying to do

1077
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:17,200
something about it. We all are reading

1078
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:19,599
better books. We were all talking about

1079
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:22,160
these things. Most people who are

1080
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:24,160
interested in our activities here have

1081
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:26,720
been trying to live these points and

1082
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:29,920
principles and are trying still to be

1083
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:33,599
better people. And this is this is the

1084
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:36,960
solution. Only by becoming better people

1085
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:40,000
can we have a better world. Only by

1086
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:43,040
curing these selfish instincts which

1087
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:47,359
have dominated us for ages can we really

1088
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:51,200
have the kind of life that we all need.

1089
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:55,280
Belshaza was quite king in his day and

1090
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:58,880
he loved to exploit and enslave people.

1091
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:01,920
He became a potential ruler of the

1092
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:05,200
world. He had joined in with a number of

1093
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:08,000
others like Genjis Khan and some of the

1094
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:09,839
early Caesars and the Greek conquerors

1095
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,359
that went out to conquer the whole

1096
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:14,319
world.

1097
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:16,880
He was the Roman Empire was the first

1098
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:20,079
great socialistic

1099
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:23,280
uh democracy or oligarchy whatever you

1100
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:26,559
want to call it. Rome became mistress of

1101
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:29,599
the world. Her colonies were everywhere.

1102
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:32,559
She owned half the globe and what other

1103
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:35,440
she didn't own she was working on.

1104
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:38,160
But in the sum of it all, Rome died and

1105
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:40,640
miserably ended because of the decay of

1106
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:43,440
the government.

1107
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:47,200
Little by little, all these imprisoned

1108
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:49,359
peoples began to break away and Rome no

1109
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:52,559
longer had the physical strength to hold

1110
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:55,520
them. Now, if this holding had not been

1111
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:58,160
a physical policing,

1112
00:51:55,520 --> 00:52:01,680
Rome might have lived another 2 or 3,000

1113
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:04,480
years. But she could not police the

1114
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:06,160
territories she had conquered. She

1115
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:09,280
should never have conquered in a way

1116
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:11,359
that required policing. It was not that

1117
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:15,040
these colonies should be controlled by

1118
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:17,440
force or by military means. They should

1119
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:19,119
have been controlled by friendship

1120
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:21,839
because these people should have be

1121
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:25,040
grateful for what Rome had done for them

1122
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:28,160
and not panicky over what Rome was doing

1123
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:32,000
to them. There was no reason why a

1124
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:35,040
conquering power should be destroyed. If

1125
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:38,079
that conquest is carried on in a spirit

1126
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:40,559
of sharing good,

1127
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:43,280
if the conquest was bringing teachers

1128
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:46,160
and idealists and inventors and artists

1129
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:49,359
and musicians into common understanding,

1130
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:51,599
if crops and and produce of all kinds

1131
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:53,040
was better, these things would be

1132
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:55,119
excused and the people would live

1133
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:56,960
together in happiness. But where

1134
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:59,599
conquest is simply putting a death spot

1135
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:01,200
over another country or putting a half a

1136
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:05,200
dozen of your death spots in different

1137
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:07,839
countries. All this is part of rule and

1138
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:10,720
ruin which is one of the problems we say

1139
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:13,599
so deeply. And of course from the time

1140
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:15,440
of Belshazzer on down the same problems

1141
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:18,000
have continued.

1142
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:21,280
And the Bible incident is perfectly

1143
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:24,400
justified in saying that there is some

1144
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:27,359
kind of a moral factor, a mystical

1145
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:29,359
factor involved. Now according to the

1146
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:33,200
Bible, of course, this mystical factor

1147
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:36,880
is deity that some way this is all due

1148
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:40,319
to the fact that deity weighs them in

1149
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:44,079
balance and found them wanting. But the

1150
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:45,359
deity that found them wanting is still

1151
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:48,720
here.

1152
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:50,880
Now if there was no deity that was found

1153
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:53,040
the morning and they simply were

1154
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:55,599
outwitted by two other nations or became

1155
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:58,240
jealous of them then we are still in the

1156
00:53:55,599 --> 00:54:00,960
same picture because today we are in the

1157
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:02,640
midst of a world that's jealous of us.

1158
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,319
We are in a world that would take over

1159
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:06,400
most of each other's countries at the

1160
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:09,760
slightest provocation

1161
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:11,839
if if any. We are in a world in which

1162
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:13,599
out of all the progress we have made

1163
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:18,319
could sometime become the greatest

1164
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:20,960
holocaust of all time, nuclear war.

1165
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:24,319
Though nothing stands between us and

1166
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:27,119
this disaster except ethics and ethics

1167
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:30,400
is a is our way of expressing divine

1168
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:33,119
will. There is only the will of deity

1169
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:36,000
between us and that difficulty.

1170
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:38,480
Now if we trust to the Lord or if we

1171
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,960
trust to the laws of nature, if we trust

1172
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:42,880
to the universal plan as we have seen it

1173
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:45,680
from the beginning of time, we are

1174
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:47,440
comparatively safe. But if we break the

1175
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:50,720
tradition that has been established by

1176
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:53,040
the ages, if we break the rules, then

1177
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:56,400
come to the same end with all other rule

1178
00:54:53,040 --> 00:55:00,079
breakers, it's our own fault. We are too

1179
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:02,640
big now, too grown up now to play

1180
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:04,720
warfare in sandboxes.

1181
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:07,440
We are no longer children throwing mud

1182
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:09,839
pies at each other. We are powerful

1183
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:12,160
individuals who have no real

1184
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:15,200
understanding of the basic unity of

1185
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:18,640
life. They were in the same type of

1186
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:21,680
situation uh that we find for instance

1187
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:24,079
in Japan at one time when the Japan was

1188
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:26,480
first open to the west. We sent a

1189
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:28,319
council general over there to act as an

1190
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:30,319
ambassador.

1191
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:32,800
The first thing that he wanted when he

1192
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:35,359
got there was beef steaks.

1193
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:37,280
And at that time, most of Japan was

1194
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:39,599
vegetarian.

1195
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:41,839
In fact, the government was subsidizing

1196
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:44,079
vegetarianism.

1197
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:46,720
So, everyone who had an animal of any

1198
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:48,480
kind rep drove it into the forest and

1199
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:50,240
hid it.

1200
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,559
And they had an awful time until they

1201
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:54,559
finally caught an old steer and finally

1202
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:56,079
got the stakes for the American

1203
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:58,400
ambassador.

1204
00:55:56,079 --> 00:56:01,440
And now on the site where this thing

1205
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:04,640
occurred is a beautiful monument topped

1206
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:06,720
by a statue of the bull who died to give

1207
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:08,319
an American ambassador his favorite

1208
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:10,559
meat.

1209
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:14,480
Now this is sort of a ridiculous

1210
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:17,760
situation but it shows the tendency that

1211
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:20,400
we have. What we want we want. What we

1212
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:23,040
had we're going to have. And this going

1213
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:26,640
on and on and on in spite of the daily

1214
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:30,319
warnings of our troubles. So if anybody

1215
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:33,040
has a real idea of doing something

1216
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:35,200
worthwhile, it might be good for them to

1217
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:38,079
sit down quietly and make a chart or

1218
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:41,520
plan of their own lives. Why are they

1219
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:44,000
alive? What are they doing? What is

1220
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:45,520
going to happen to what they have? Who

1221
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:49,119
is going to use it better than they

1222
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:52,000
have? Why are we going to leave this to

1223
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:55,359
that and that to this? What is behind

1224
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:57,119
all this? We have more a few more years

1225
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:59,520
of life. What are we going to do with

1226
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:02,160
them? Are we going to keep right on

1227
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:04,160
wasting them? Are we going to live so

1228
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:05,839
that the doctor's bills eat up most of

1229
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:08,319
our estate?

1230
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:10,480
Are we going to get tangle into troubles

1231
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:12,880
with other people until the lawyers eat

1232
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:14,880
up the rest of the estate? Are we going

1233
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:17,520
to live this way or are we going to

1234
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:20,079
gradually begin to put the world in

1235
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:22,400
order? Put it into a pattern of

1236
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:27,119
realities. put it into a pattern of

1237
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:31,680
facts and values with which we can live.

1238
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:34,079
The idea that we want too much seems to

1239
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:36,559
be universal

1240
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:39,359
and money becomes the only answer to

1241
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:41,599
that. Well, it's all right if people

1242
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:42,960
want what they can get, I guess, but

1243
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:44,559
they shouldn't want what is

1244
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:48,000
unreasonable.

1245
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:51,119
They get nothing out of it. I have read

1246
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:54,319
recently several accounts of some of our

1247
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:55,920
very wealthy theatrical people. When I

1248
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:57,440
mean wealthy, I mean that who have

1249
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:59,040
fortunes up into the hundreds of

1250
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:02,480
millions.

1251
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:05,280
Not one of these people is happy. Not

1252
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:06,799
one of them has many real friends. Not

1253
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:09,200
one of them knows what to do with the

1254
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:11,760
money.

1255
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:16,160
And uh most of it will probably

1256
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:17,760
ultimately be doled out as alimonies.

1257
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:20,240
Nobody seems to know what they're going

1258
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:23,359
to do with this great wealth. They can

1259
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:25,760
only sleep in one bed. They can only

1260
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:28,400
live in one house. So, they get a summer

1261
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:30,160
house, a yacht, and a winter house and

1262
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:33,599
loan it to their friends cuz they never

1263
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:36,880
go there. Or they go up to Las Vegas and

1264
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:38,400
be relieved of some of their spare cash.

1265
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:41,200
These are the things that people

1266
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:42,720
struggle and die for to get that bank

1267
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:44,960
account and they don't know what to do

1268
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:47,200
with it after they get it. It doesn't do

1269
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:49,280
them anything in the term of happiness.

1270
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:51,359
They're just as miserable as the poor.

1271
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:52,880
In fact, more miserable. And many of

1272
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:54,559
them are sitting up all night with their

1273
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,720
lawyers trying to figure out how to

1274
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:59,599
balance their taxes.

1275
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:00,960
And so, this is the desirable thing.

1276
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:04,079
This is the thing that lifts people

1277
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:06,559
above all competition in life. The

1278
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:09,359
simple life is still the best. the

1279
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:12,480
simple life of the individual who has

1280
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:15,599
what he needs, a reasonable amount of

1281
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:17,920
luxury, but not enough wealth to destroy

1282
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:19,520
the next three generations of his own

1283
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:21,599
family.

1284
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:24,400
If he has too much money, his children

1285
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:27,599
will suffer. And if that goes on, their

1286
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:31,359
children will suffer. And wealth is the

1287
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:35,839
root of indolence and waste. And this

1288
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:39,760
planet is too much now depleted by waste

1289
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:42,799
to continue indefinitely in this way. So

1290
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:46,240
religion, it seems to me, should include

1291
00:59:42,799 --> 00:59:49,680
not only a love of God and a love of our

1292
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:53,200
fellow man, but a determination to

1293
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:57,440
protect our world from corruption as far

1294
00:59:53,200 --> 01:00:00,799
as we can do so. to prevent waste, to

1295
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:03,760
prevent the misuse of natural resources,

1296
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:06,720
and to put the conservation of resources

1297
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:09,119
and energies as a primary part of our

1298
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:11,200
faith, not as something that has to be

1299
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:13,680
worked out by our politicians in

1300
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:17,680
Washington or in some state capital.

1301
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:20,480
Religion should mean that a world in

1302
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:23,119
which we are enriching values

1303
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:26,400
of a really religious people will always

1304
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:30,640
be a people protecting the sacred things

1305
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:35,040
of life, protecting love and friendship

1306
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:38,559
and faith and kindness and compassion.

1307
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:40,880
These are the things that enrich life.

1308
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:44,079
The other things material and otherwise

1309
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:47,280
really in the end impoverish life.

1310
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:50,079
We we need to have the closeness that

1311
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:52,880
comes from a simple sympathy for each

1312
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:54,799
other. A kind of relationship by which

1313
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:58,160
we will not in any way that we can

1314
01:00:54,799 --> 01:01:00,640
prevent injure any other person. So that

1315
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:04,000
uh we can we can begin to live with some

1316
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:07,200
of these things and by living this way

1317
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:10,559
we will fulfill part of this Bible story

1318
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:12,960
that we are so much concerned with. The

1319
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:16,880
the siege of Troy

1320
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:19,599
is a story of the of a two-fold world

1321
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:21,920
locked in conquest

1322
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:24,480
over a vanity.

1323
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:28,880
The great wars of the ancients were

1324
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:31,040
fought for power and glory and wealth.

1325
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:33,760
The great wars of the middle ages were

1326
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:38,000
fought for physical power or clerical

1327
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:40,240
power. The great crusades

1328
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:43,200
were the same thing we see coming back

1329
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:45,520
today in the problem of Islam and

1330
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:48,319
Christianity.

1331
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:51,839
Back in the crusades, the Christians

1332
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:53,680
lost the war. They could not regain the

1333
01:01:51,839 --> 01:01:56,480
Jerusalem which remained in the hands of

1334
01:01:53,680 --> 01:02:01,680
the infidel. But when it was all over

1335
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:03,839
and the crusade ceased, the infidel

1336
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:06,000
voluntarily opened the roads of

1337
01:02:03,839 --> 01:02:08,240
pilgrimage so that the followers of

1338
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:11,200
Christians could visit the holy city in

1339
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:12,720
perfect safety whenever they wanted to.

1340
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:15,520
But they weren't going to have it taken

1341
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:18,640
away from them by force.

1342
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:21,760
Sulleon the magnificent and as a master

1343
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:24,400
it is said uh Rabbi my monities one of

1344
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:26,960
the greatest of the Jewish scholars. So

1345
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:29,520
little by little uh we are going to have

1346
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:32,960
to take care of this. We have two

1347
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:36,640
militant creeds now and Muslimism and

1348
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:39,440
Christianity are dangerous loggerheads.

1349
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:42,319
The faiths are more or less quiet but

1350
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:44,880
are still very very strong. Small groups

1351
01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:48,240
like the six are beginning to give great

1352
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:50,799
trouble everywhere. The problem of

1353
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:52,559
religion is taking on a militant

1354
01:02:50,799 --> 01:02:55,200
atmosphere.

1355
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:57,760
And this we do not want. This should be

1356
01:02:55,200 --> 01:03:00,319
stopped immediately. But it will never

1357
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:04,480
stop as long as we call anyone who

1358
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:06,319
disagrees with us in theology a heathen.

1359
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:09,359
This is something that we have no right

1360
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:11,599
to do because we have no right to to

1361
01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:13,839
believe that the individual with the

1362
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:16,960
right heart and the right mind cannot

1363
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:20,079
just see as far into the truth of things

1364
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:22,480
as the members of our own denominations.

1365
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:25,680
It is all a matter of beginning to

1366
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:27,839
realize that if we don't live together,

1367
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:30,319
we're going to leave a barren world

1368
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:32,640
perhaps to the animals or the insects.

1369
01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:36,000
We don't know. But we cannot keep it

1370
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:37,760
going this way. And religions still

1371
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,880
aren't on speaking terms with each

1372
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:42,480
other. Each one is has its own

1373
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:44,319
infallibility.

1374
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:46,640
And we have a hundred new sex that have

1375
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:49,520
arisen in the last 10 years. Each of

1376
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:52,319
which is the only one that is perfect.

1377
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:54,799
So all these things gather again, the

1378
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:57,520
same things taking on new clothes with

1379
01:03:54,799 --> 01:04:00,720
the same ideas in every case going on

1380
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:03,280
and on and on. This we've got to get out

1381
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:05,920
of our systems. If we can't change other

1382
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:08,720
people, at least we can begin to temper

1383
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:11,760
our own attitudes on these things. And

1384
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:15,520
if even a small fragment of society

1385
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:18,480
really changes its way of life, that

1386
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:19,920
change can be developed into a world

1387
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:22,640
movement.

1388
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:24,880
The very tools that we want to get rid

1389
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:26,400
of can be used to help us to get rid of

1390
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:29,359
them

1391
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:32,319
because we can prove conclusively to

1392
01:04:29,359 --> 01:04:35,760
anyone's commit that that a good piece

1393
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:37,839
of merchandise at a proper price is

1394
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:40,720
better for all concerns than a poor

1395
01:04:37,839 --> 01:04:42,799
piece at a high price. We have accepted

1396
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:45,920
the high price because it's part of a

1397
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:47,839
great competitive era. But gradually we

1398
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:50,640
are waking up to the fact that

1399
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:52,240
competition is nothing but generalized

1400
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:54,880
selfishness.

1401
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:57,599
It is not a virtue and the pro the

1402
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:59,760
proceeds of it have no blessing before

1403
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:01,520
man or deity.

1404
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:04,079
So all these things come up and they

1405
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:07,680
work. But it's nice to realize how the

1406
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:11,039
Bible has anticipated them and then

1407
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:15,520
given this power that makes things work

1408
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:18,640
into a pattern makes this power God.

1409
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:21,359
The God that wrote the in living fire

1410
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:22,880
the tablets of the law on the crest of

1411
01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:26,720
Si.

1412
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:29,359
This deity was not visible to Moses.

1413
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:33,359
But Moses is supposed to have been a

1414
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:36,400
lawgiver and he seems to have been wise

1415
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:39,200
in the wisdom of the Egyptians and other

1416
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:41,359
strange people of the past.

1417
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:43,520
Whatever it is, he touched the the

1418
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:47,039
Phoenician and the Calaldian and the

1419
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:49,039
Babylonian and the Assyrian foundations

1420
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:52,160
of knowledge.

1421
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:54,640
Then someone said, "Well, what was this

1422
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:57,200
handwriting on the wall?"

1423
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:59,119
And nobody could read it.

1424
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:03,039
Well, there was a man by the name of

1425
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:06,319
Garrett who was the astronomer pardon me

1426
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:08,000
Gaper who was the astronomer of Cardinal

1427
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:09,920
Rishelu

1428
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,880
and he wrote a little book called

1429
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:15,359
unheard of curiosities

1430
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:17,039
and he had an answer for that question

1431
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:18,720
which might not be the only one. It

1432
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:21,359
might not be the real one but it is

1433
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:23,760
certainly an interesting one. He says

1434
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:25,680
that the whole concept was based on the

1435
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:29,440
Hebrew alphabet.

1436
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:32,400
In other words, the constellations

1437
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:35,359
are the consonants constellations in the

1438
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:38,160
heavens are the consonants or Hebrew

1439
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:41,920
consonant letters. The planets are the

1440
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:44,480
vowels which move constantly through the

1441
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:46,640
patterns of the constellations. And in

1442
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:49,599
every move they make they spell out

1443
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:52,799
words because in every word there must

1444
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:55,280
be a vowel. And in many cases in the

1445
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:58,160
Hebrew the vowels are not written. But

1446
01:06:55,280 --> 01:07:00,720
in any event the motion of these vowels

1447
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:03,680
through the star groups with each of the

1448
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:06,640
consonants a letter to results in an

1449
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:08,640
endless pattern of words. And these

1450
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:11,599
words if they can be understood or

1451
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:13,920
analyzed or explained might tell us the

1452
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:17,520
whole story. For instance, if you have

1453
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:21,200
two constellations that one is a B and

1454
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:25,039
one is a T, then the vowel move vowels

1455
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:28,160
move through it. If you put a A moves

1456
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:30,720
through it, it becomes bat.

1457
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:33,200
If a wager thought comes through it, it

1458
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:35,359
becomes a bit

1459
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:38,079
and so on. All of the forms of the

1460
01:07:35,359 --> 01:07:41,440
letters and if something else is very

1461
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:43,839
small, it becomes a bit.

1462
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:47,839
All these letters moving through the

1463
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:51,280
constellations create an an immense con

1464
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:53,680
sequence of word poems. And if we could

1465
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:57,039
read those word poems with the

1466
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:59,920
constellations and the planets in them,

1467
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:02,720
we might have the secret of a celestial

1468
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:05,200
language that has been in use since the

1469
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:07,599
beginning of time. It might be in some

1470
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:10,000
respect similar to our astrological

1471
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:13,599
speculations, but it is not prophetic

1472
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:16,480
necessarily. It simply tells, if we know

1473
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:19,600
how to read it, that there is a constant

1474
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:21,920
communication of energies between the

1475
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:24,319
invisible world of causes and the

1476
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:26,799
visible world of effects. It's a very

1477
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:28,799
stimulating and interesting idea and I

1478
01:08:26,799 --> 01:08:31,359
think sometime someone will do something

1479
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:33,199
with it. We have Gerald's book, by the

1480
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:35,920
way, if anyone is interested. which is

1481
01:08:33,199 --> 01:08:38,560
in our library collection. But in all

1482
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:41,359
cases, we're looking for an answer.

1483
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:45,040
We're looking for some way to solve this

1484
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:46,880
problem. We see the handwriting coming

1485
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:49,679
in a thousand different ways,

1486
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:52,799
particularly in red letters in our own

1487
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:54,239
hearts. We know something is wrong. We

1488
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:56,319
know that the world that we're bringing

1489
01:08:54,239 --> 01:08:59,120
our children into is not the world that

1490
01:08:56,319 --> 01:09:01,120
we want them to be in. And we know that

1491
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:02,560
they do not know a better world because

1492
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:05,839
we've never been able to convince them

1493
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:09,040
of it. But if we could prove to instance

1494
01:09:05,839 --> 01:09:11,759
to members of any major faith that their

1495
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:15,199
own stories, the fables and legends and

1496
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:18,239
myths of religion are all of them

1497
01:09:15,199 --> 01:09:21,040
explanations of universal laws in their

1498
01:09:18,239 --> 01:09:25,199
various aspects. And that these stories

1499
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:27,199
therefore all tell of what God is doing

1500
01:09:25,199 --> 01:09:30,000
to certain things under certain

1501
01:09:27,199 --> 01:09:32,480
circumstances and conditions. And with

1502
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:34,000
that realization to work from, it seems

1503
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:36,159
as though we ought to be able to solve

1504
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:39,040
some of these problems.

1505
01:09:36,159 --> 01:09:41,359
Actually, the beginning of it all is not

1506
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:44,239
that we should dash off and try to join

1507
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:47,759
some religion. The thing is that we

1508
01:09:44,239 --> 01:09:51,839
should grow up with our reading,

1509
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:54,400
writing, arithmetic all cooperating to

1510
01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:57,199
help us to become better people and not

1511
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:59,280
just simply smarter people. And there

1512
01:09:57,199 --> 01:10:02,320
should be reading, writing, original,

1513
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:04,960
arithmetic and ethics.

1514
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:07,760
There should be an idealism in every

1515
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:11,360
heart in the world. A dream of something

1516
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:14,960
better. A dream that can be fulfilled to

1517
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:17,440
some degree by anyone who wants to may

1518
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:20,239
give the time and effort to it. But a

1519
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:23,280
life should be a span of years in which

1520
01:10:20,239 --> 01:10:26,320
at least a part is dedicated to the

1521
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:29,040
service of the eternal plan upon which

1522
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:33,120
we all depend for existence and without

1523
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:35,840
which the world itself falls into chaos.

1524
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:38,400
And uh with now that so many people are

1525
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:41,280
becoming interested in these things, it

1526
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:43,760
is very important that we judge these

1527
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:47,679
people and these organizations

1528
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:51,760
thoughtfully and always remembering that

1529
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:55,120
the real sincere uh group of people or

1530
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:57,920
individuals are the ones who give all

1531
01:10:55,120 --> 01:11:02,320
and demand the least. that they want

1532
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:05,760
more and more of people to love each

1533
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:09,280
other, serve each other, protect each

1534
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:12,320
other. They are not in business. They

1535
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:15,040
are in idealism,

1536
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:17,600
philosophy, ethics,

1537
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:20,480
morality and all the things that help to

1538
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:24,320
make a better world. And if we can find

1539
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:28,080
groups of this kind uh which have within

1540
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:31,360
them a reasonable degree of integrities

1541
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:34,239
and a reasonable degree of dedication,

1542
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:36,719
we can help them all to do better work

1543
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:38,480
and we can do better ourselves. Because

1544
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:40,480
when we work for something bigger than

1545
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:42,000
we are, that is the time when we have a

1546
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:44,960
right to feel a little bit bigger

1547
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:47,920
ourselves. But while we are not doing

1548
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:51,120
things to help, we are without knowing

1549
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:53,760
or realizing doing things to hinder. And

1550
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:56,239
this is no time for hindrance. This is a

1551
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:57,840
time for all individuals to renew their

1552
01:11:56,239 --> 01:12:00,880
dedications

1553
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:02,400
to the principles of reality and

1554
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:06,080
integrity.

1555
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:09,120
It is only through a quiet consistent

1556
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:11,760
service of each other that we can prove

1557
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:14,719
conclusively that religion is in our

1558
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:17,600
hearts and in our daily lives. And

1559
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:19,760
wherever anyone has a religious life

1560
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:22,800
that is dedicated, they may have

1561
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:26,159
troubles. Their religious life that is

1562
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:28,880
honorable is not particularly popular or

1563
01:12:26,159 --> 01:12:31,040
too widespread. It is not appreciated

1564
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:33,199
because it interferes with corruption

1565
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:35,679
and nearly every good person has had to

1566
01:12:33,199 --> 01:12:38,960
fight corruption. But it is a great

1567
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:41,679
fight. It is a worthwhile fight and the

1568
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:44,719
individual who wins is already on his

1569
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:47,679
way to a better state of existence. So

1570
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:50,719
we do all we can but let's remember that

1571
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:53,600
these stories in these scriptures about

1572
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:57,679
all the wonders that God does. Job and

1573
01:12:53,600 --> 01:13:01,520
his comforters and uh all the Samson and

1574
01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:04,239
Delilah and the Song of Solomon and all

1575
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:08,239
of these stories, fables and legends are

1576
01:13:04,239 --> 01:13:11,120
based upon centuries of experience with

1577
01:13:08,239 --> 01:13:13,120
principles that are immutable

1578
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:16,000
that while the story may be fashioned

1579
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:19,520
any time, maybe as late as tomorrow it

1580
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:23,840
will come, but the fact behind the

1581
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:27,360
story, the symbol is the concealing part

1582
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:30,239
of a great moral truth. And the moral

1583
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:32,239
truth is that the final end of all

1584
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:35,440
things for the constructive value of

1585
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:37,760
mankind is that all human beings will

1586
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:39,760
unite in the love of the divine

1587
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:42,400
principle and in the service and

1588
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:44,880
affection for each other. This is what

1589
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:47,600
we have to have if we're going to solve

1590
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:49,440
the issues of the day. And I think now

1591
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:52,440
we better bring it to a close this

1592
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:52,440
morning.
